# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of analysis:
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees based on which title held/department they worked in to help management better prepare for new hiring. In addition, I also queried to find the number of employees eligible to participiate in a mentorship program, which quickly allows us to find emails of all eligible participants and extend this mentorship offer with just a few clicks.

## Results:
```
| count | title              | 
|-------|--------------------| 
| 29414 | Senior Engineer    | 
| 28254 | Senior Staff       | 
| 14222 | Engineer           | 
| 12243 | Staff              | 
| 4502  | Technique Leader   | 
| 1761  | Assistant Engineer | 
| 2     | Manager            | 
```
- Based on the query result above, we can see that the highest number of employees that are eligible to retire are either senior engineers or other senior staff 
- Conversely, the lowest count is managers, having only 2 eligible for retirement during this time
- Looking at the entire table above as a whole, it is alarming to see that the number of senior employees potentially leaving soon doubles that of other employees
- From the mentorship eligibility table, we note there are almost 1,549  potential retirees who are eligible for this program

## Summary of results:
- Looking at the initial data files, we can determine that Pewlett-Hackard has roughly 300,000 employees. Based on the results above, I would strongly advise management to look for many senior engineers and other staff that could quickly assimilate into PH to fill the gap of potentially almost 50,000 senior employees retiring. PH needs to find employees who are up to par with industry standards that could work with minimal mentorship. In the grand scheme of things, there are roughly 85,000 employees total who could potentially retire, and many of the retiring staff may be experienced and well versed in maintaining the company's infrastructure. Lastly, I would advise management to push senior employees to create training regimens including slide decks or written guides to help train the next generation of workers.
